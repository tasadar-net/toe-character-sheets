# Character Sheets
Here are some redesigns of character sheets as PDFs, mostly based on designs from MrGone.
They are sorted after rule module in folders.

WARNING: These will be deprecated once ToE-DCS (Dynamic Character Sheets for the Web, backed by github gists) is completed. The development of this will commence in the https://github.com/tionis/toe-dcs namespace as the github tasadar-net organization is to much unneeded overhead.
